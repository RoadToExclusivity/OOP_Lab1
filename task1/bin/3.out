Returns the character currently pointed by the internal file position indicator of the specified stream. The internal file position indicator is then advanced to the next character.

If the stream is at the end-of-file when called, the function returns EOF and sets the end-of-file indicator for the stream (feof).

If a read error occurs, the function returns EOF and sets the error indicator for the stream (ferror).

fputc and putc are equivalent, except that putc may be implemented as a macro in some libraries.
